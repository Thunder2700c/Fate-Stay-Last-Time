Chapter 1: Hour 0 – The Flap of the Leather (Part 1)
Hour 0: The Ludhiana Trap
The air in the Ludhiana banquet hall was a suffocating cocktail of heavy jasmine perfume, roasting spices, and the stifling, radiant body heat of six hundred people. The bass from the DJ’s speakers vibrated through the marble floor, a rhythmic, relentless thumping that resonated in my chest. To anyone else, this was the pinnacle of celebration—a grand Punjabi wedding, dripping in gold jewelry, flashing lights, and forced smiles. To me, it was a sensory overload.
I have always been a mediator by nature, someone who preferred the quiet hum of a cooling fan and a glowing monitor to the chaotic crossfire of extended family politics. I was the architect of my own worlds—spending my nights plotting the cosmic scales of The Gods Rank Awakening—but here, in the real world, I was just Gurtej, expected to play the part of the dutiful, well-dressed guest.
My armor for the evening was a heavily embroidered, midnight-blue sherwani, paired with a pristine set of golden jutti. They were traditional, elegant, and entirely rigid. I had bought them specifically for this occasion, assured by the vendor that they were crafted from the finest leather.
They were, in truth, a tragedy waiting to happen.
It occurred at exactly 11:43 PM. The buffet had just opened, causing a mass migration of guests across the polished marble. I stepped away from my designated table, shifting my weight to navigate around a group of gossiping aunts. I planted my right foot. I lifted my heel.
Snap.
It wasn't a tear. It was a structural failure. The sound was sharp, brittle, and terrifyingly final.
I froze. A cold spike of adrenaline pierced the humid haze of my brain. I didn't look down immediately. I didn't have to. I could feel the sudden, drafty exposure of my toes against the cold marble. The entire front half of the golden sole had detached from the upper fabric, hanging on only by a few stubborn threads near the heel.
Just keep moving, my mind screamed. Slide the foot. Don't lift it. Slide it.
I attempted a slow, agonizing shuffle toward the perimeter of the hall, hoping to reach the shadows near the catering exit. I took a step.
Slap.
The detached sole hit the marble floor like a judge's gavel. It was incredibly, impossibly loud. The acoustics of the grand hall seemed to isolate that single, pathetic sound, amplifying it over the thumping bass of the music.
Slap. Slap.
I tried to walk faster, my panic rising. With every rushed movement, the ruined shoe acted like a demented flipper, violently smacking against the ground and rebounding against the top of my foot.
"Hey. Gurtej."
The voice cut through the ambient noise like a serrated blade. I stopped, the ruined shoe hanging limply from my foot. I turned my head slowly.
Standing a few feet away was my cousin. He was the antithesis of everything I stood for—loud, brash, and obsessed with the shallow currency of social media clout. He was holding a plate of paneer tikka in his left hand. In his right, held up at eye level, was his smartphone. The camera lens was pointed directly at the floor. Directly at my foot.
His face was contorted into a grin so wide and unhinged it looked painful. His eyes were wide, gleaming with the malicious realization that he had just struck digital gold.
"Oh, man," he breathed, his voice trembling with suppressed laughter. "This is absolute gold."
He tapped the screen. A tiny red light blinked to life.
"Stop," I said, my voice barely a whisper, strained with sudden, desperate panic. I am not a confrontational person. My instinct was to withdraw, to diffuse. "Put the phone away. Seriously."
He didn't listen. He took a step closer, angling the phone to get a clear, illuminated shot of the demolished jutti.
"Walk, bro," he goaded, his grin widening. "Come on, take a step. Let the people see the swagger."
I turned away, my face burning with a heat that rivaled a furnace. I had to get out of the hall. I abandoned the shuffling strategy and power-walked toward the heavy glass exit doors.
SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP!
The noise was a rapid-fire drumbeat of humiliation. My cousin threw his head back and let out a braying, breathless roar of laughter. It was a cruel, infectious sound.
"Look at him!" my cousin shouted over the DJ’s track, panning his camera up to catch my horrified, flushed face, then immediately snapping it back down to the flapping shoe. "The man is walking like a duck with a broken flipper! Absolute tragedy!"
The laughter spread. It rippled outward from my cousin, infecting the tables nearest to us. Uncles paused with drinks halfway to their mouths. Cousins pointed. Young children giggled at the funny sound. Dozens of eyes turned to watch the spectacle. A few more smartphones were raised, flashes blinding me in the dim ambient lighting of the hall.
I pushed through the heavy glass doors, the stifling air conditioning giving way to the thick, smoggy heat of the Ludhiana night. I practically ran across the gravel parking lot, finally kicking the ruined golden shoe off my foot entirely. It hit the dirt with a pathetic thud. I unlocked my car, threw myself into the driver's seat, and slammed the door shut, locking it instantly.
The silence of the car's interior was deafening, broken only by my own ragged breathing. Through the tinted window, I could see the glowing entrance of the banquet hall. Even from here, I could imagine the grinning face of my cousin, replaying the footage.
I gripped the steering wheel until my knuckles turned white. I thought it was just a bad night. A minor embarrassment that would be gossiped about for a week and forgotten.
I had no idea the timer had just started. Earth had exactly 70 hours left.
Hour 1: The Countermeasure
The drive back to my house was a blur of neon streetlights and blinding headlights. My mind was racing, cycling through the worst-case scenarios. I knew my cousin. I knew the way his mind worked. He wasn't going to just keep that video on his camera roll.
I stormed into my dark, quiet house, ignoring the stillness, and headed straight for my room. I didn't even bother turning on the main lights. I threw off the heavy sherwani, dropping it to the floor, and dropped into my desk chair.
I woke up my laptop. The familiar boot sequence flashed across the screen. I bypassed my standard Windows partition and immediately booted into my Linux environment. The sleek, dark interface of my Kali Linux distro materialized.
For the past year, I had been diving deep into web development and ethical hacking. I knew how to build the architecture of the web, which meant I knew how fragile it could be. My MBA background had taught me the cold, hard mathematics of viral marketing and algorithmic reach; I knew that if that video hit the right nodes, the engagement metrics would compound exponentially.
I opened a terminal window, my fingers flying across the mechanical keyboard.
I pulled up his Instagram, his X account, his YouTube channel.
Refresh.
Nothing yet.
Refresh.
Nothing.
I opened a suite of network tools, preparing scripts I had learned to mass-report, to spam-flag, to do anything I could to bury a URL the second it went live. I stared at the terminal, the blinking green cursor reflecting in my eyes. I was an INFP. I despised conflict. But sitting in the dark, watching the terminal, I felt a cold, calculated rage building in my chest.
Refresh.
At Hour 1, exactly 48 minutes after the shoe broke, the feed updated.
There it was. Uploaded to all three platforms simultaneously via a syndication tool.
The title was clickbait perfection, optimized for maximum humiliation.
“Bro’s Shoe Gave Up on Life 💀🦆 #WeddingFail #Cringe #DuckWalk”
I immediately ran my scripts. I flooded the reporting system. I tried to ping his IP, trying to find a vulnerability in his home network, anything to force a router reset or a device crash. But I was fighting a war with a pocketknife.
I watched the metrics on the screen.
100 views in the first minute.
500 views in minute two.
The algorithm had picked it up. People were sharing it to group chats. It was hitting the "For You" pages.
By the end of Hour 1, it had crossed 10,000 views. The comments were flooding in, an endless scrolling waterfall of laughing emojis, mocking insults, and strangers dissecting my panic.
I sat back in my chair, the green light of the terminal washing over my face. I had failed to stop it. The digital contagion had breached containment.
Hour 2 to 5: The Algorithmic Avalanche
I didn't sleep. I couldn't. The glow of the monitor was the only light in my room, casting long, sharp shadows against the walls. By Hour 2, the video had breached the containment of our extended family's WhatsApp groups and bled into the local Ludhiana network.
My phone, sitting innocuously next to my keyboard, began to vibrate. First, it was a slow, intermittent buzzing. Then, it became a continuous, sickening hum.
Buzz.
GNIMT BBA 4th Sem Group: "Bro is that Gurtej?? 💀"
Buzz.
GNIMT BBA 4th Sem Group: "No way, look at the duck walk! 😂"
I picked up the phone, my thumb hovering over the screen. I am an INFP. My personality type is literally the "Mediator." I process the world through a deep, internal compass of feelings and ideals. Confrontation physically drains me; public humiliation feels like a localized tectonic event in my chest.
I muted the group chat. Then I muted my notifications entirely. But the silence didn't stop the numbers on my laptop screen from climbing.
I switched tabs back to the terminal. I tried running a reverse IP lookup, hoping to find a vulnerability in the cousin's local network. Maybe I could fry his router, corrupt the original file. But the internet doesn't work like that anymore. The original file didn't matter. The video had been duplicated, downloaded, and re-uploaded across hundreds of meme pages.
By Hour 4, the algorithm had decided my fate. The video hit the "Explore" pages. It was no longer just a funny video of a guy from Punjab with a broken shoe; it was "The Ultimate Wedding Fail."
I watched the view counter on the primary upload cross 10 million.
It was a terrifying realization of powerlessness. All my knowledge of web development, all the hours spent building sites for my web novel, The Gods Rank Awakening, all the Linux commands I had mastered—none of it could stop the sheer, crushing weight of human schadenfreude. The internet was a beast, and my cousin had just thrown me into its maw.
Hour 6 to 9: Global Contagion
The sun began to rise over Ludhiana, casting a dull, smoggy orange light through my window blinds. The birds started their morning calls, completely ignorant of the fact that my life was effectively over.
By Hour 6, the western hemisphere woke up. The video crossed the oceans.
It hit X (formerly Twitter). It hit Reddit. Influencers with millions of followers began to stitch the video, adding their own exaggerated, mocking reactions. The "Duck Walk Flap" became a trending audio. People were recording themselves tying loose pieces of cardboard to their shoes and flopping around their kitchens for likes.
I sat there, my eyes burning, my throat dry. I hadn't moved from my chair in six hours.
At Hour 8, my cousin went live on Instagram.
I clicked on his profile, a masochistic urge compelling me to watch. He was sitting in his air-conditioned room, grinning into the camera.
"Yeah, guys, that was my cousin!" he laughed, reading the chat. "The shoe just gave up! I swear, I’ve never seen a man try so hard to look cool while flapping like a penguin. The golden jutti, man. RIP."
Then, he did something that snapped the final tether holding my sanity to the concept of a peaceful resolution. He turned his phone screen to the camera, showing his analytics dashboard.
Views: 450,000,000
Estimated Revenue: $140,000 (and climbing)
He was getting rich. He was building an empire on the ruins of my dignity.
"Keep sharing, guys!" he cheered. "Let's hit a billion!"
Hour 10 to 12: The Breaking Point and the Descent
A billion. A thousand million people. One-eighth of the human population.
By Hour 12, the momentum was unstoppable. Major news outlets were picking it up as a "viral human interest" story. "The Shoe That Broke the Internet," they called it.
I finally stood up. My joints popped, stiff from the tense, sleepless night. I looked at myself in the mirror hanging on the back of my door. My eyes were bloodshot, shadowed by dark circles. I looked like a ghost.
I looked at the poster of Fate/stay night on my wall. I thought about the concept of Heroic Spirits—beings of immense, conceptual power summoned to fight in wars that determined the fate of the world. In the stories, Masters summoned them for the Holy Grail, for wishes, for salvation.
I don't want salvation, I thought, the coldness finally settling into my bones, freezing out the embarrassment and leaving only a pure, diamond-hard resolve. I want erasure.
This Earth had proved its nature. It was a world that rewarded cruelty with currency. It was a timeline entirely corrupted by vanity, digital algorithms, and the mass consumption of humiliation. It was a Lostbelt. And what do you do with a Lostbelt?
You prune it.
I walked out of my room and headed for the front door. The sun was fully up now. The heat of the day was already pressing down. I walked to my car, parked exactly where I had left it last night.
I crouched down in the dirt. There, lying pathetically in the dust, was the ruined golden jutti. The catalyst.
I picked it up. It felt heavy with the conceptual weight of a billion laughing voices. I didn't go back to my room. I carried the ruined shoe, the physical manifestation of my destruction, down the narrow concrete steps into the dark, unfinished basement of my house.
I flicked on the single overhead bulb. It cast harsh shadows across the dusty concrete floor.
I didn't need chalk. I didn't need mercury or dragon's blood. I took out a pocketknife, pressed the blade to my palm, and drew a single line of crimson. Then, I began to draw the circle.
The 70-hour timer was ticking. The age of the internet was about to end in a flash of silver and gold.
