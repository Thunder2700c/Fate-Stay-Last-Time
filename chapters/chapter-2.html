            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 13 to 14: The Architecture of Vengeance</h2>

            <p>The basement beneath my house was a relic of unfinished construction, a cavern of exposed brick, dusty concrete, and the lingering smell of damp earth. It was completely isolated from the suffocating heat of the Ludhiana afternoon above. Down here, the world felt distant. The incessant buzzing of my phone, the notifications, the billion pairs of eyes—none of it could penetrate the concrete.</p>

            <p>I knelt in the center of the floor. My hands were shaking, not from fear, but from a profound, chilling exhaustion.</p>

            <p>The catalyst lay before me: the ruined golden jutti. It was no longer just a piece of torn leather; it was an artifact imbued with the conceptual weight of absolute humiliation. In the rules of magecraft, an object gathers power based on the human emotions tied to it. This shoe was currently the focal point of a billion laughing minds. It was heavy with a dark, toxic gravity.</p>

            <p>I didn't have liquid mercury or crushed gems. I had myself. I took the pocketknife and pressed it against my palm. The sting was sharp, grounding me. I let the blood drip onto the dusty concrete, dragging my finger to draw the summoning circle. I traced the intricate geometric patterns I had memorized from my obsessions, marrying the logic of web architecture with the chaotic lines of an arcane array.</p>

            <p>My blood mixed with the dust. It wasn't perfect, but it was fueled by a desperation that defied logic. I stepped back, my chest heaving. The air in the basement was already growing heavy, the atmospheric pressure dropping as if a storm were brewing directly overhead.</p>

            <p>I closed my eyes. I didn't reach out to the Root or the traditional magic circuits—I didn't have them. Instead, I reached inward, into the core of my own shattered ideals, into the absolute rejection of the reality above me.</p>

            <p class="incantation" data-typed>
                "Let silver and steel be the essence.<br>
                Let stone and the archduke of contracts be the foundation."
            </p>

            <p>The blood on the concrete glowed—faint, sickly red.</p>

            <p class="incantation" data-typed>
                "Let rise a wall against the wind that shall fall.<br>
                Let the four cardinal gates close.<br>
                Let the three-forked road from the crown<br>
                reaching unto the Kingdom rotate."
            </p>

            <p>The single lightbulb hanging from the ceiling flickered, then shattered. The basement was plunged into darkness, illuminated only by the violently surging light of the circle. The air cracked with static electricity. The ruined shoe vibrated, lifting inches above the ground.</p>

            <p class="incantation" data-typed>
                "I hereby declare.<br>
                Your body shall serve under me.<br>
                My fate shall be with your sword.<br>
                Submit to the beckoning of the Holy Grail.<br>
                If you will submit to this will and this reason...<br>
                then answer!"
            </p>

            <p>The prana tornado roared, deafening me. The pressure was immense, crushing my lungs. I felt as if my very soul was being pulled through a dial-up modem, stretched across the dimensions of the Kaleidoscope.</p>

            <p class="incantation" data-typed>
                "An oath shall be sworn here!<br>
                I shall attain all virtues of all of Heaven.<br>
                I shall have dominion over all evils of all of Hell.<br>
                From the Seventh Heaven,<br>
                attended to by three great words of power..."
            </p>

            <p>I threw my bloody hand forward.</p>

            <p class="incantation" data-typed>
                "Come forth from the ring of deterrence,<br>
                Protector of the Holy Balance!"
            </p>

            <div class="scene-break">
                <span class="drip"></span>
            </div>

            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 15: The Manifestation of Myth</h2>

            <p>The explosion of mana didn't just rattle the basement; it shook the foundation of the house. A blinding pillar of azure and crimson light erupted from the circle, forcing me to shield my eyes. The sheer force of it blew the dust off the concrete, leaving the air tasting of ozone and ancient iron.</p>

            <p>As the light faded, the heavy, suffocating silence returned, but it was different now. It was the silence of a predator entering a room.</p>

            <p>The smoke cleared. Two figures stood within the boundaries of the blood-drawn circle.</p>

            <p>The first was a woman. She was clad in silver armor that gleamed with an ethereal, unblemished light, over a dress of deep, royal blue. Her golden hair was tied back, and her emerald eyes locked onto mine with a piercing, sovereign intensity. She held her hands as if resting them on the pommel of a sword, but the blade itself was invisible, masked by swirling currents of wind. Artoria Pendragon. Saber. The King of Knights.</p>

            <p>Beside her stood a man who looked like he had been forged in a dying star. He wore a dark, form-fitting breastplate and a vibrant, crimson shroud that seemed to absorb the dim light. His skin was tanned, his hair shock-white, and his steel-gray eyes scanned the basement with the cold, cynical calculation of a veteran assassin. EMIYA. Archer. The Wrought Iron Hero.</p>

            <p>Saber stepped forward, the steel of her boots clinking against the concrete.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"I ask of you. Are you my Master?"</p>
            </div>

            <p>I looked at the blood drying on my palm.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"I am."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Archer crossed his arms, leaning back slightly. He didn't look at me right away; he looked at the ruined golden shoe resting at the edge of the circle.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"A dual summon. And with a catalyst dripping in such... pathetic resonance. No Command Seals on your hand, Master. No Holy Grail in sight. Just a basement and a broken shoe. Tell me, what exactly have you dragged us into?"</p>
            </div>

            <div class="scene-break">
                <span class="drip"></span>
            </div>

            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 16 to 18: The Briefing of the Viral War</h2>

            <p>I didn't try to stand. I sat on a wooden crate, the adrenaline crash leaving me dizzy.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"There is no Holy Grail. Not here. There are no other Masters. There is no Clock Tower oversight."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Saber frowned, her invisible blade shifting slightly.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Then why have we been called from the Throne of Heroes? A Heroic Spirit is a weapon of humanity's defense. If there is no war, if there is no threat to the Human Order..."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"The Human Order <em>is</em> the threat."</p>
            </div>

            <p>I pulled out my smartphone—the device I had dreaded looking at for the past eighteen hours. I unlocked it and placed it on the crate between us. I brought up the video. The analytics. The comments.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Thirteen hours ago, my shoe broke at a wedding. My cousin recorded it. He uploaded it to a global digital network. Right now, over one billion people are watching it. They are laughing. He is making a fortune off of my absolute humiliation. My life, my future, my dignity—it was all erased for a joke."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Saber stared at the small screen. Her brow furrowed in deep confusion.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"A... moving picture? Sent across the world? And this... 'billion' people... they mock you for a failure of equipment? Where is the honor in this? Where is the challenge?"</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"There is none."</p>
            </div>

            <p>He had stepped closer, his gray eyes reading the screen, analyzing the engagement metrics and the syndication networks. As a Counter Guardian from the modern era, he understood exactly what he was looking at.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"It's an algorithmic slaughter. A digital crucifixion."</p>
            </div>

            <p>He looked at me, his gaze piercing through my skull.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"You didn't summon us to fight a Magus. You summoned us to fight a server farm. You want us to kill a meme."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"No. I want you to kill the world that made it."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="scene-break">
                <span class="drip"></span>
            </div>

            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 19 to 24: The Contract of Erasure</h2>

            <p>Silence stretched across the basement.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"You ask me to destroy the innocent because the guilty walk among them? That is not justice, Master. That is a massacre. I am a Knight. I will not turn my blade against humanity over a wounded pride."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Are they innocent? A billion people watched a man's dignity burn and turned it into entertainment. Not one person in a billion said 'stop.' Silence in the face of cruelty is complicity. You know this, King of Knights. Camelot didn't fall because of one traitor. It fell because the rest of the kingdom watched it happen."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Saber flinched. It was barely perceptible—a tightening of the jaw, a fractional shift in her grip on the invisible blade. But I saw it. I had found the crack in the armor of the King.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"A compelling argument, Master. But there is a mechanical flaw in your grand execution. Look at your hand. You have no Command Seals. No enforcement mechanism. If Saber or I decide to walk away right now, there is absolutely nothing binding us to you."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Then walk."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Archer raised an eyebrow, genuinely caught off guard.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"I'm serious. I won't force you. I won't trick you. If you stay, it's because you agree that a world built on this kind of cruelty deserves what's coming. That's the only contract I'm offering."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Saber was silent for a long time. When she spoke again, her voice was quieter. Not defeated, but resolved.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"If this world has truly abandoned its honor... I will be your sword, Gurtej. But know this—if I find even one soul worth saving before the end, I will stay my blade."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"...A contract of conviction rather than compulsion. How absurdly idealistic. Fine. I've followed worse reasons to the end of the world."</p>
            </div>

            <p>I looked at the terminal on my laptop upstairs in my mind's eye.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"First, we blind them. Archer, you are going to rip the cousin's digital empire to shreds. You are going to burn his servers to the ground."</p>
            </div>

            <p>The 70-hour timer ticked down. We were at Hour 24. The counter-attack had begun.</p>
