            <!-- ========== HOUR 25 TO 28 ========== -->
            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 25 to 28: Structural Grasp and the Digital Forge</h2>

            <p>We abandoned the basement and moved upstairs to my bedroom, the nerve center of my previous, quiet life. The sun had set over Ludhiana, plunging the city back into its smoggy, neon-lit night. My room, usually a sanctuary for web development and writing <em>The Gods Rank Awakening</em>, now served as the war room for the end of the world.</p>

            <p>Archer looked around with a detached, cynical curiosity. He noted the Fate poster on the wall, the empty coffee mugs, and finally, my dual-monitor desktop setup humming in the corner.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"A crude forge. But the underlying principle of a network is no different from the leylines of a territory. It is all just pathways of energy."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Can you trace it?"</p>
            </div>

            <p>I sat in my chair and pulled up the IP logs I had managed to scrape before the syndication networks blocked my ping requests.</p>

            <p>Archer didn't ask for the keyboard. He reached out his tanned, scarred hand and placed it flat against the side of the PC casing.</p>

            <p class="incantation" data-typed>"Trace On."</p>

            <p>Faint, glowing green circuits resembling microscopic circuitry crawled up his arm, reflecting in his steely eyes. As a magus who specialized in Structural Grasp, Archer didn't just understand the physical makeup of a sword; he could comprehend the entire history, composition, and conceptual purpose of any object he touched. Right now, he was grasping the architecture of the modern internet.</p>

            <p>For three hours, the room was dead silent except for the whirring of the CPU fan. Archer stood like a statue, his mind projecting across fiber-optic cables, traversing the globe at the speed of light. He bypassed firewalls not by guessing passwords, but by conceptually understanding the flaws in their coding.</p>

            <p>At Hour 27, the numbers on my screen stopped moving.</p>

            <p>The view count on the primary video, which had been spinning like a slot machine, froze.</p>

            <p class="metrics">1,104,560,000 views — FROZEN</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"I have located the primary server nodes hosting the visual data. And I have traced the financial conduits. The 'Mora' he has gathered... it flows through a dozen digital banks."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Burn it."</p>
            </div>

            <p>My voice was completely devoid of its usual INFP hesitation. The mediator was dead.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"With pleasure."</p>
            </div>

            <p>He didn't type a single line of code. He simply pushed a surge of raw prana into the machine, translating magical energy into malicious digital commands. In servers located in California, Dublin, and Tokyo, hard drives began to spin out of control. Cooling fans were commanded to stop. CPUs over-volted. Rack after rack of servers caught fire, their physical hardware melting down under the unnatural strain.</p>

            <p>At Hour 28, my cousin's bank accounts, crypto wallets, and ad-sense revenue streams were systematically drained to absolute zero. Archer didn't steal the money; he conceptually erased the ledgers.</p>

            <p class="metrics">Revenue: $140,000 → $0.00</p>
            <p class="metrics">Crypto Wallets: ERASED</p>
            <p class="metrics">Ad-Sense: TERMINATED</p>

            <div class="scene-break">
                <span class="drip"></span>
            </div>

            <!-- ========== HOUR 29 TO 32 ========== -->
            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 29 to 32: The Panic and the Mercenaries</h2>

            <p>I opened my phone and went to my cousin's Instagram. He was live.</p>

            <p>He was sitting in an upscale hotel room—he had already left town, likely to celebrate his sudden wealth. He was mid-sentence, laughing with his viewers, when his expression suddenly faltered. His eyes darted off-screen.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker cousin">Cousin</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Wait, what?"</p>
            </div>

            <p>The live chat was flooding with confused messages.</p>

            <p class="notification">Viewer: "Bro, the video is down."</p>
            <p class="notification">Viewer: "Link is dead."</p>
            <p class="notification">Viewer: "Did you delete it?"</p>

            <p>My cousin picked up a secondary phone. His face drained of color. He tapped furiously, his breathing picking up.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker cousin">Cousin</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"No, no, no... the bank app is down. Everything is... it says zero."</p>
            </div>

            <p>I watched the sheer, unadulterated terror wash over the man who had ruined my life. It was intoxicating. But a rat backed into a corner will always bite.</p>

            <p>He ended the stream abruptly. What he did next, I pieced together from the network traffic Archer was monitoring. My cousin had connections—shady ones he had bragged about at family gatherings. Using a hidden, offline cache of funds he hadn't digitized yet, he made a frantic call to the dark web. He believed he was under a massive, coordinated cyber-attack by a rival syndicate or a disgruntled hacker group.</p>

            <p>He hired a PMC—a Private Military Company that operated off the books.</p>

            <p>But there was a complication he didn't foresee. The Clock Tower—the hidden society of modern magi—had orbital satellites and leyline monitors. They had detected the massive surge of True Ether from my basement when Saber and Archer were summoned. They knew a Holy Grail-class event had occurred in Ludhiana.</p>

            <p>The Clock Tower Enforcers intercepted my cousin's PMC contract. They took over the operation. They weren't coming for my cousin's money; they were coming to secure the Master who had illegally summoned Heroic Spirits.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Master. We are no longer alone."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="scene-break">
                <span class="drip"></span>
            </div>

            <!-- ========== HOUR 33 TO 36 ========== -->
            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 33 to 36: The Siege of Ludhiana</h2>

            <p>It was 2:00 AM. The heavy, oppressive heat of the Punjab night hung over my street.</p>

            <p>I looked out the window. The neighborhood was dead quiet. The stray dogs that usually roamed the alleys were gone, their instincts warning them of the unnatural presence approaching.</p>

            <p>Four matte-black SUVs rolled down my narrow street, their headlights extinguished. They moved with absolute, terrifying precision. They parked at the four corners of my property, boxing my house in.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Tactical operatives. Armed with modern kinetic weapons. But there are others. Three distinct prana signatures. Magi. Clock Tower hounds."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Saber."</p>
            </div>

            <p>My heart was hammering against my ribs, the reality of physical violence finally crashing into my digital warfare.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Do not fear, Master. They are merely men. I am a Knight."</p>
            </div>

            <p>She didn't draw her sword, but the air around her began to swirl, a miniature cyclone forming in the cramped bedroom. Her blue and silver armor materialized over her casual clothing with a flash of light.</p>

            <p>At Hour 34, they breached.</p>

            <p>A localized bounded field—a Bounding Barrier—was thrown over my house, cutting off all sound from the outside world. To our neighbors, my house would appear completely silent, even as all hell broke loose.</p>

            <p class="sound-effect">CRASH.</p>

            <p>The front door was blown off its hinges by a shaped charge. Flashbangs were tossed into the living room, filling the ground floor with blinding light and deafening noise. Six PMC operatives clad in heavy tactical gear stormed in, assault rifles raised, sweeping the rooms with laser sights.</p>

            <p>Saber didn't use the stairs. She stepped to the floorboards of my bedroom, gathered prana into her armored boots, and plummeted straight through the floor, shattering the wood and plaster to land directly in the center of the living room.</p>

            <p>The operatives opened fire. The deafening roar of automatic gunfire filled the house.</p>

            <p class="sound-effect">BRRRRRRT!</p>

            <p>But the bullets never touched her.</p>

            <p>Invisible Air—the bounded field of wind that cloaked Excalibur—acted as a flawless, impenetrable shield. The high-caliber rounds struck the compressed wall of cyclone-force wind surrounding her and were deflected, ricocheting harmlessly into the walls and ceiling.</p>

            <p>The operatives froze, their tactical training completely useless against a phenomenon that defied physics.</p>

            <p>Saber moved. To the human eye, it was just a blur of silver. She didn't use the blade; it would be a dishonor to cut down mere mortals with a holy sword. She used the flat of the invisible blade and her gauntleted fists.</p>

            <p>In less than three seconds, all six men were unconscious on the floor, their armor dented by blows that carried the weight of a freight train.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"The vanguard is subdued."</p>
            </div>

            <p>But then, the front wall of my living room simply... dissolved.</p>

            <p>The three Clock Tower Enforcers stepped through the rubble. They wore long, dark coats, holding mystic codes—staves and jeweled daggers that hummed with stored magical energy.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker cousin">Enforcer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Surrender the Servants, boy. You are an unregistered anomaly. By order of the Mage's Association, this territory is forfeit."</p>
            </div>

            <p>I walked to the edge of the shattered floorhole, looking down at the Enforcers. Archer stood behind me, manifesting his black bow.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"They don't understand, do they?"</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Magi rarely do. They think they are dealing with a rogue spellcaster. They don't realize they are standing on ground zero of a timeline erasure."</p>
            </div>

            <p>The clock struck Hour 36. The digital war was over. The physical war had begun. And my cousin was still out there, hiding in the mountains.</p>
