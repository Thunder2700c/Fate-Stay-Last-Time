            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 37: The Disparity of Myth</h2>

            <p>The three Clock Tower Enforcers stood amidst the rubble of my living room wall, their crests glowing beneath their heavy coats. The lead Magus, a man with cold, aristocratic features, raised a staff carved from petrified wood. The air pressure in the room spiked as he began a high-speed incantation, drawing ambient mana to form a localized bounded field of absolute zero temperature.</p>

            <p>He intended to freeze Saber in place. It was a spell that would have shattered a modern tank.</p>

            <p>He didn't even get to finish the third stanza.</p>

            <p>From the shattered floorhole above, Archer released the bowstring. There was no sound of a snap, only a terrifying shriek as the air itself was torn apart. A crimson, twisted arrow—a modified, localized version of Caladbolg—struck the ground exactly one millimeter in front of the lead Magus's boots.</p>

            <p>It didn't explode with fire. It exploded with spatial distortion.</p>

            <p>The Magus's spell was instantly canceled as the mana in the air was sucked into a microscopic vacuum, warping the floorboards, the rubble, and the Enforcer's staff into a twisted spiral of useless matter. The Magus fell backward, gasping for breath, his magic circuits completely shorted out by the conceptual weight of the broken phantasm.</p>

            <p>The other two Enforcers panicked. They abandoned their aristocratic poise and drew mystic codes—short, jagged blades dripping with corrosive curses. They lunged at Saber.</p>

            <p>Saber sighed, a sound of profound disappointment.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"You bring curses to a Knight's domain?"</p>
            </div>

            <p>She didn't swing her sword. She simply channeled a fraction of her magical energy into her boots—Prana Burst. She kicked the floor. The resulting shockwave acted like a localized earthquake. The two Enforcers were thrown backward, slamming into the opposite wall with bone-crunching force. They slumped to the ground, unconscious before they even registered what hit them.</p>

            <p>The battle for my house had lasted exactly forty-five seconds.</p>

            <p>I walked down the stairs, stepping over the splintered wood and the groaning bodies of the PMC mercenaries. The house I had grown up in was ruined. The walls were riddled with bullet holes, the furniture was shredded, and the front door was a gaping maw looking out into the muggy Punjab night.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Master. The perimeter is secure. But more will come. The Mage's Association does not accept defeat lightly."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Her armor gleamed under the flickering streetlights outside.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Let them come."</p>
            </div>

            <p>My voice was eerily calm. Just two days ago, a bad grade in my BBA classes at GNIMT would have ruined my week. Now, standing over the bodies of elite assassins, I felt absolutely nothing. The INFP mediator inside me had been burned away by the sheer absurdity of the world.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"We aren't staying."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="scene-break">
                <span class="drip"></span>
            </div>

            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 38 to 41: The Departure</h2>

            <p>Outside, the four matte-black SUVs belonging to the PMC were idling, their drivers having fled the moment the spatial distortion tore through the living room.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Archer."</p>
            </div>

            <p>He materialized beside the lead vehicle, his red shroud snapping in the night breeze.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"The cousin's location, Master?"</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Did you get it before you fried the networks?"</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"I did. When his accounts zeroed out, he panicked. He used an encrypted satellite phone to activate a contingency. A high-altitude bunker deep in the Himalayas, near the border. It's a relic from an old corporate war, retrofitted with modern defenses. He bought it with offline funds."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"He thinks altitude and concrete can save him. Saber, can you drive?"</p>
            </div>

            <p>Saber approached the heavy, armored SUV. She ran a gauntleted hand along the hood. Thanks to her Riding skill—an innate ability of the Saber class to master any mount or vehicle—she didn't just know how to drive it; she understood its mechanical soul better than the engineers who built it.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"It is a crude chariot. But it will suffice."</p>
            </div>

            <p>I climbed into the passenger seat. Archer dematerialized into spirit form to conserve prana, though his presence lingered in the back seat like a cold shadow.</p>

            <p>Saber put the vehicle in gear. The tires squealed against the asphalt as we tore out of my neighborhood. I didn't look back. I didn't look at my ruined house, or the city of Ludhiana fading in the rearview mirror. The timer was at 66 hours. We had a world to end.</p>

            <div class="scene-break">
                <span class="drip"></span>
            </div>

            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 42 to 45: The Ascent into the Cold</h2>

            <p>We drove north, leaving the flat, suffocating heat of Punjab behind. The highway stretched out like a dark ribbon under the moon. As the hours bled away, the terrain began to shift. The sprawling urban sprawl gave way to the foothills, and then, the towering, jagged silhouettes of the Himalayas.</p>

            <p>The temperature dropped rapidly. I turned the SUV's heater on, watching my breath fog the glass.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"You are quiet, Master. Are you mourning the life you left behind?"</p>
            </div>

            <p>Her eyes were fixed on the winding, treacherous mountain roads, taking hairpin turns at eighty miles an hour with absolute, terrifying precision.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"No. I'm just realizing how fragile it all was. Everything I cared about—my reputation, my studies, my future—it was all destroyed by a broken shoe and a laugh. If a world's foundation is that brittle, it was never real to begin with."</p>
            </div>

            <p>I rested my head against the cold glass.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"A harsh judgment. But not an inaccurate one. Humanity has always built castles on sand. The only difference now is that they build them out of data. And data is so very easy to erase."</p>
            </div>

            <p>His voice echoed from the back seat, though he remained invisible.</p>

            <p>By Hour 45, the paved roads ended. We were driving on treacherous, snow-covered dirt paths hugging the edge of sheer drops. The air grew thin. The sky began to lighten, casting a pale, icy blue glow over the snow-capped peaks.</p>

            <p>Archer manifested in the back seat. He leaned forward, his gray eyes scanning the desolate, frozen wasteland ahead.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"We are approaching the coordinates. I sense a massive grid of thermal optics, motion sensors, and... automated sentry guns. He has turned this mountain into a fortress."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Can you bypass the sensors?"</p>
            </div>

            <p>Archer replied, a dangerous smile touching his lips.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"I don't need to. Stealth is for assassins. We are an execution squad."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="scene-break">
                <span class="drip"></span>
            </div>

            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 46 to 48: The Gates of the Coward</h2>

            <p>At Hour 48, we crested a massive ridge. Below us, nestled in a natural basin surrounded by jagged peaks, was the stronghold.</p>

            <p>It was a brutalist structure of reinforced concrete and steel, half-buried in the mountain. Massive blast doors sealed the entrance. Along the perimeter walls, I could see the distinct shapes of automated, heavy-caliber machine gun turrets tracking our SUV as Saber brought it to a halt on the ridge.</p>

            <p>Inside that bunker, surrounded by concrete and guns, my cousin was hiding. He was likely staring at monitors, watching our vehicle, wondering how the hell I had tracked him, and praying his money had bought him enough steel to survive.</p>

            <p>I stepped out of the SUV. The Himalayan wind hit me like a physical blow, biting through my thin clothing. I didn't care. The cold only sharpened my focus.</p>

            <p>Saber stepped out beside me, the icy wind whipping her golden hair. The cold did not bother her; she was a dragon in human form.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Master. The defenses are entirely mechanical. There are no human souls manning those walls."</p>
            </div>

            <p>She looked down at the fortress.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"He trusts machines more than people. Archer."</p>
            </div>

            <p>My breath plumed in the freezing air. Archer materialized on the roof of the SUV. He didn't draw his twin blades. He extended his left hand.</p>

            <p class="incantation ubw" data-typed>"I am the bone of my sword."</p>

            <p>He chanted softly, the aria vibrating in the thin mountain air.</p>

            <p>A massive, asymmetrical black bow materialized in his grip. In his right hand, he projected Hrunting—the Hound of the Red Plains. It wasn't an arrow; it was a demonic sword, jagged and glowing with a thirsty, crimson light. He nocked the sword onto the bowstring.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Take out their eyes."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Archer drew the string back, the sheer tension of the prana causing the air around him to warp and hum. He aimed not at the gates, but at the central communications tower protruding from the top of the bunker.</p>

            <p>He released.</p>

            <p>The sound was like a thunderclap echoing across the mountains. The crimson streak crossed the two-mile gap in a fraction of a second. It struck the tower, and the resulting explosion of raw magical energy shattered the concrete, melting the radar dishes and severing the bunker's connection to the outside world.</p>

            <p>The automated turrets on the walls immediately swiveled, locking onto our position on the ridge. A deafening roar filled the valley as dozens of heavy machine guns opened fire, filling the air with a storm of lead.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Saber."</p>
            </div>

            <p>I spoke without even flinching as the bullets chewed up the snow a hundred yards below us. She summoned Excalibur, the invisible blade gathering a violent vortex of wind.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Clear the path."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Saber leapt from the ridge. She didn't run down the mountain; she fell like a meteor, a streak of silver and blue hurtling directly toward the storm of bullets and the unbreakable blast doors of the fortress.</p>

            <p>The timer ticked to Hour 49. The final siege had begun.</p>
