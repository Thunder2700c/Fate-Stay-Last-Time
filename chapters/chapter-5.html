            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 49: The Meteor of Avalon</h2>

            <p>To witness a Heroic Spirit in true combat is to understand the terrifying insignificance of modern man.</p>

            <p>I watched from the freezing ridge as Saber descended. She did not fall; she struck. The automated turrets—weapons capable of tearing a reinforced tank to shreds in seconds—swiveled their heavy barrels toward her, vomiting a continuous, deafening stream of high-caliber lead. The tracers lit up the Himalayan night like a swarm of angry, mechanical fireflies.</p>

            <p>It meant nothing.</p>

            <p>Saber's Prana Burst enveloped her in a localized cyclone of azure mana. The bullets didn't just miss; they were caught in the conceptual pressure of her aura, their kinetic energy robbed, falling to the snow like dead insects. She hit the ground with the force of a localized earthquake. The snowpack exploded outward in a fifty-foot radius, revealing the bare, frozen rock beneath.</p>

            <p>She stood before the massive, steel blast doors of my cousin's bunker. They were a meter thick, designed to withstand a direct tactical nuclear strike.</p>

            <p>Saber didn't even drop into a combat stance. She raised both gauntleted hands and placed them flat against the freezing steel.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Begone."</p>
            </div>

            <p>She didn't swing a sword. She simply released the compressed prana within her core directly into the molecular structure of the doors. The steel groaned—a horrific, shrieking sound of metal being forced beyond its breaking point—and then, it simply blew inward. The doors crumpled like tin foil, tearing off their massive hydraulic hinges and crashing into the dark tunnel beyond, taking the inner sentry guns with them.</p>

            <p>Silence descended over the valley, broken only by the howling of the mountain wind.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"The path is clear, Master. But the atmosphere... it has changed."</p>
            </div>

            <p>He spoke softly from beside me, having dispersed his bow, his eyes fixed on the gaping maw of the fortress. I felt it too. I didn't have magic circuits, but the sheer density of the air making my teeth ache wasn't just the altitude. It felt like standing next to an open furnace. The ley lines of the mountain were screaming.</p>

            <div class="scene-break">
                <span class="drip"></span>
            </div>

            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 50 to 52: The Descent into the Anomaly</h2>

            <p>We walked down the ridge and entered the bunker. The interior was a stark contrast to the brutalist exterior—it was a high-tech marvel of glass, LED lighting, and polished concrete. But the lights were flickering. The emergency alarms were blaring a dull, rhythmic red.</p>

            <p>As we pushed deeper, stepping over the ruined husks of automated defense drones that Saber had casually dismantled, the feeling of wrongness intensified.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"This is not just a bunker. The ambient mana is too thick. It is pooling here. Consolidating."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Her emerald eyes narrowed as she scanned the long corridors.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"The Lesser Grail. Master, your summoning in Ludhiana... it was a massive, unregistered spike of True Ether. You didn't just summon two Servants; you acted as a conceptual flare. You woke up the dormant ley lines of the Himalayas. The World is trying to correct the anomaly by initiating a localized Holy Grail War."</p>
            </div>

            <p>A grim realization dawned on his face as he looked back at me.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Meaning what?"</p>
            </div>

            <p>My voice echoed in the metallic hallway.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Meaning the rules of engagement have changed. And a Grail requires multiple Masters."</p>
            </div>

            <p>We reached the end of the corridor. A set of opulent, reinforced mahogany double doors stood incongruously in the center of the concrete. This was the inner sanctum.</p>

            <p>I pushed them open.</p>

            <div class="scene-break">
                <span class="drip"></span>
            </div>

            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 53: The Sanctum of Vanity</h2>

            <p>The room was vast, lined with banks of supercomputers and massive monitors. But the monitors were all dead, fried by Archer's earlier digital assault. At the far end of the room, sitting in a plush leather executive chair, was my cousin.</p>

            <p>He looked terrible. His designer suit was wrinkled, his hair was a mess, and his face was pale with a mixture of terror and sleep deprivation. But as we stepped into the room, a twisted, arrogant smirk slowly crawled across his face.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker cousin">Cousin</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Gurtej. You actually came. You dragged a couple of cosplayers all the way to the top of the world because you couldn't handle a little joke."</p>
            </div>

            <p>His chuckle was dry and hysterical.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"The joke is over. Your servers are ashes. Your money is gone. The world is going to forget you ever existed. It's time to pay the toll."</p>
            </div>

            <p>I spoke coldly, walking toward him. My cousin laughed. He stood up, leaning against his desk. He raised his right hand.</p>

            <p>Glowing on the back of his hand, burning with a toxic, crimson light, were three Command Seals shaped like a golden chalice.</p>

            <p>My breath hitched.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker cousin">Cousin</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"You think you're the only one who can play this game? When my money started vanishing, I didn't just hire guns, Gurtej. I made a call to the dark web. A Magus in London was selling a relic—a piece of a fossilized snake skin. Cost me fifty million offline dollars. He said it was a 'catalyst' for a god. When the mountain started glowing an hour ago... I figured out what he meant."</p>
            </div>

            <p>The air in the room didn't just grow heavy; it completely vanished. The sheer pressure of the Mystery that suddenly filled the space forced me to my knees. Saber immediately stepped in front of me, manifesting her invisible blade, her posture shifting into a hyper-defensive stance.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Master, get back!"</p>
            </div>

            <p>Her voice was laced with a genuine, raw alarm I had never heard from her before.</p>

            <p>Golden dust began to materialize in the air behind my cousin. It gathered, condensing into a swirling vortex of pure, arrogant light. The temperature spiked. The concrete floor began to crack under the weight of the entity manifesting.</p>

            <p>From the golden light stepped a man.</p>

            <p>He possessed a beauty that was entirely inhuman, with crimson eyes that looked upon the world not as a home, but as a garden he owned. He wore gleaming, golden armor that radiated an ancient, oppressive majesty.</p>

            <p>Gilgamesh. The King of Heroes.</p>

            <div class="scene-break">
                <span class="drip"></span>
            </div>

            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 54 to 57: The Golden Mockery</h2>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"To think that the King would be called to a cavern of dirt and wire, summoned by a mongrel whose only claim to power is numbers on a glass screen."</p>
            </div>

            <p>His voice was a resonant, melodic purr that demanded absolute obedience. He looked at my cousin with absolute, undisguised disgust.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker cousin">Cousin</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Hey. I paid for you! You're my Servant. Kill them!"</p>
            </div>

            <p>His voice trembled despite his arrogance. Gilgamesh didn't even look at him.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Silence, mongrel. A king does not take orders from a swine who buys his crown with the laughter of fools. However..."</p>
            </div>

            <p>His crimson eyes shifted, locking onto Saber. A cruel, possessive smile curled his lips.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Saber. You continue to reject my proposals, yet fate continually places you before my throne. And who is this accompanying you? A faker? A Master who crawls on the floor?"</p>
            </div>

            <p>Gilgamesh looked down at me. He saw right through me. He didn't see a threat; he saw a bug.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"You seek to destroy this world over a wounded pride? How utterly mundane. This world is a garden of weeds, yes, but it is my garden. If it is to be pruned, it will be by my hand, not the tantrum of a broken mediator."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Gilgamesh. Step aside. This Master's cause is absolute. This timeline is forfeit."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Her voice rang with the authority of Camelot.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Absolute? Nothing is absolute but my treasury!"</p>
            </div>

            <p>He laughed, throwing his head back. The space behind the Golden King began to warp. The air rippled like water disturbed by a stone. Golden portals, dozens of them, opened in the fabric of reality. Slowly, the hilts of ancient, legendary Noble Phantasms emerged from the ripples. Swords, spears, halberds—the original prototypes of every myth in human history, glowing with deadly intent.</p>

            <p>The Gate of Babylon.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</span>

            <div class="scene-break">

            </div>

            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 58 to 59: The Rain of Death</h2>

            <p>He fired.</p>

            <p>The weapons shot from the golden portals like missiles, breaking the sound barrier within the confined space of the bunker.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Saber!"</p>
            </div>

            <p>She didn't retreat. She stepped into the storm. Her invisible blade moved faster than human thought.</p>

            <p class="sound-effect">Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

            <p>Sparks filled the room as she deflected a cursed spear, parried a demonic broadsword, and shattered a crystalline halberd.</p>

            <p>But there were too many. Gilgamesh wasn't even moving. He just stood there, his arms crossed, watching Saber dance through the lethal rain with a sadistic grin.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Is this all the King of Knights can muster? Dance for me, Saber! Show me the limits of your dying ideals!"</p>
            </div>

            <p>A curved scimitar slipped past Saber's guard, grazing her shoulder armor and drawing a line of bright red blood. I watched in horror. The most powerful Knight in history was being pinned down, completely overwhelmed by the sheer, absurd volume of the King's treasury.</p>

            <p>My cousin was laughing again. He had pulled out his phone. Even without internet, he was recording. He was recording my death.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker cousin">Cousin</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"See, Gurtej? Money always wins! Even in magic, money buys the best toys!"</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">

            </div>

            <p>I ordered, but she couldn't. If she moved, the barrage would turn me into a red mist in a microsecond.</p>

            <p>Suddenly, a blur of red stepped in front of me.</p>

            <div class="scene-break">
                <span class="drip"></span>
            </div>

            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 60: The Counter Guardian's Answer</h2>

            <p>Archer walked past me. He didn't have his bow. He didn't have his twin blades. He walked with a slow, deliberate cadence, straight into the lethal zone of the Gate of Babylon.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Archer, what are you doing?!"</p>
            </div>

            <p>She yelled, deflecting a heavy mace.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"I'm taking out the trash."</p>
            </div>

            <p>His voice was eerily calm.</p>

            <p>Gilgamesh narrowed his crimson eyes, finally acknowledging the man in the red shroud.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"You step forward to die, Faker? A nameless dog trying to bite a god?"</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"You talk too much, your Majesty. You rely on the weight of others' legends because you have none of your own to wield. You aren't a warrior. You're just a very wealthy thief."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Gilgamesh's face contorted in absolute, divine fury.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"I will turn you to ash, mongrel!"</p>
            </div>

            <p>The golden portals behind Gilgamesh doubled. Then tripled. A hundred Noble Phantasms aimed directly at Archer's chest.</p>

            <p>Archer stopped walking. He closed his eyes.</p>

            <p>The air in the bunker stopped moving. The ambient mana didn't just pool; it ignited. A blue flame began to burn beneath Archer's feet, spreading outward in a perfect circle. It was a terrifying, sorrowful energy—the crystallized manifestation of a man who had been betrayed by his own ideals, who had slaughtered millions for the sake of a peace that never came.</p>

            <p>He opened his eyes. They were not gray anymore; they were burning with the light of a dying star.</p>

            <p>Archer raised his right hand, his voice dropping into an octave that resonated in my very soul. He was not casting a spell. He was declaring a truth against the World.</p>

            <p class="incantation ubw" data-typed>"I am the bone of my sword."</p>

            <p>The blue fire expanded, rushing past me, past Saber, washing over the concrete and the computer banks.</p>

            <p class="incantation ubw" data-typed>"Steel is my body and fire is my blood."</p>

            <p>Gilgamesh fired. A hundred legendary weapons shrieked through the air, aimed to annihilate the Counter Guardian.</p>

            <p class="incantation ubw" data-typed>"I have created over a thousand blades."</p>

            <p>Archer didn't move. The weapons struck him—or rather, they struck the space where he was. The air shattered like glass. The weapons were swallowed by a sudden, localized vacuum of space-time.</p>

            <p>Gilgamesh's eyes widened in shock.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"What is this...?"</p>
            </div>

            <p class="incantation ubw" data-typed>"Unknown to Death."</p>

            <p>The walls of the bunker began to dissolve. The concrete peeled away like burnt paper, revealing a sky composed of massive, turning gears.</p>

            <p class="incantation ubw" data-typed>"Nor known to Life."</p>

            <p>The temperature plummeted, then skyrocketed. The floor beneath us turned into cracked, barren earth. Swords—hundreds, thousands of them—began to sprout from the ground like rusted grass.</p>

            <p class="incantation ubw" data-typed>"Have withstood pain to create many weapons."</p>

            <p>A harsh, desolate wind blew through the new world, carrying the scent of iron and ash. Saber stood in awe, her invisible blade lowering. Even she, a King, was bearing witness to the ultimate taboo of magecraft.</p>

            <p class="incantation ubw" data-typed>"Yet, those hands will never hold anything."</p>

            <p>Archer looked up at Gilgamesh. The King of Heroes was no longer standing in a high-tech bunker. He was standing on a hill of swords, surrounded by a limitless horizon of weapons, lit by a smog-choked sun.</p>

            <p>Archer extended both arms, his red shroud snapping violently in the wind of his own soul. He looked back at me, his Master, and gave a small, cynical smirk.</p>

            <p class="incantation ubw" data-typed>"So as I pray..."</p>

            <p>The world snapped into place.</p>
