            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 61 to 62: The Hollow Clash</h2>

            <p>The sky of Unlimited Blade Works was choked with ash and turning gears, a mechanical purgatory forged from a single man’s regrets. But the silence of the wasteland was instantly shattered by the deafening roar of mythic artillery.</p>

            <p>Gilgamesh opened the Gate of Babylon. Golden portals blanketed his side of the reality marble, unleashing a torrent of legendary weapons. But Archer did not move. He didn't need to trace new blades. They were already here.</p>

            <p>With a mere thought, the rusted swords buried in the barren earth ripped themselves free, launching into the air like iron missiles. Demonic spears clashed against holy broadswords mid-flight. Crystalline halberds shattered against nameless, wrought-iron replicas. The sky ignited with continuous, blinding shockwaves of violently displaced mana.</p>

            <p>I didn't notice it then—the way my cousin's shadow seemed to pool unnaturally against the rusted earth, darker than the smog-choked sky above. A subtle, rotting chill clung to the periphery of the Reality Marble, a whisper of Hassan-i-Sabbah waiting patiently for the King's distraction.</p>

            <div class="prana-gauge">
                <div class="pg-label">Master Prana Reserves</div>

                <span class="pg-status">CRITICAL — No Command Seals — Circuit Hemorrhage</span>
            </div>

            <p>The toll of the Reality Marble was not being paid by Archer alone. I dropped to my knees, clutching my chest. It felt as though someone had injected battery acid directly into my veins. The sheer volume of magical energy required to sustain this forge against the King of Heroes was bleeding me dry.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box ubw-mode">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Master, stay down! The Grail has fully awakened beneath this mountain. Because you lack Command Seals, it recognizes us as rogue entities. It is restricting my mana intake. I have exactly one hundred and eighty seconds before my Spirit Core collapses and this world shatters!"</p>
            </div>

            <p>Archer yelled over the thunderous explosions, his red shroud torn, his skin cracking with glowing blue fissures as he pushed his Magic Circuits to the absolute brink.</p>

            <p>Saber stood over me, her invisible blade raised, deflecting the stray shrapnel that rained down upon us. She looked at the apocalyptic sky, then down at my trembling hands. Her emerald eyes were filled with a profound, agonizing conflict.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Master... the sheer scale of this destruction... I must tell you now. I will protect you to my dying breath. I swore to be your sword. But even if we survive this bunker, I cannot use Excalibur to destroy the Earth. I cannot! There are still innocents out there who know nothing of your pain. I will not let them burn for the sins of the cruel."</p>
            </div>

            <p>I grit my teeth, tasting blood from my bitten lip. I didn't argue. I didn't have the breath to. The mediator in me was gone, but the King's honor remained an immovable object.</p>

            <div class="scene-break"><span class="drip"></span></div>

            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 63: The Evolved Shadow</h2>

            <p>Across the wasteland, my cousin was panicking. The fifty-million-dollar god he had purchased was being matched by a man in a red coat. The cousin's arrogant facade crumbled into pure, unadulterated terror.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker cousin">Cousin</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Kill him! Just use the sword that destroys worlds! I command you! Use the Seals!"</p>
            </div>

            <p>He raised his right hand, the three crimson Command Seals glowing with a toxic light. Gilgamesh turned his head, his crimson eyes narrowing with absolute, murderous disgust. He would never allow a rat to force him to draw <em>Ea</em>.</p>

            <p>But the cousin never finished the incantation.</p>

            <div class="shadow-emergence">
                <span class="se-class">Assassin — 2nd Evolutionary Form</span>
                <span class="se-name">Hassan-i-Sabbah</span>
                <span class="se-desc">A wraith-class anomaly born from the corrupted Grail's shadow. It had been waiting inside the cousin's own darkness, patient as death itself.</span>
            </div>

            <p>The unnaturally dark shadow cast by his own boots suddenly twisted, surging upward and elongating across the dirt. The ambient temperature plummeted. A foul, suffocating miasma of death poured from the darkness.</p>

            <p>Rising from the shadow was not a normal Servant. It was an anomaly—an Assassin that had achieved its 2nd-stage evolutionary form. It was a towering, wraith-like monstrosity draped in tattered bandages and bone-white armor, radiating a curse so dense it made the very ground rot beneath it. The corrupted Hassan-i-Sabbah had been waiting for the exact moment the master's panic left him vulnerable.</p>

            <p>Before anyone could react, the Assassin's elongated, clawed hand swept upward.</p>

            <p>The cousin's head detached from his shoulders. Blood sprayed across the rusted swords as his body collapsed, the smartphone he had been clutching tumbling into the dirt.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker assassin">Assassin</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"...The false master is severed... the shadow claims the toll..."</p>
            </div>

            <p>The entity's voice was a chorus of a thousand dying echoes.</p>

            <p>Gilgamesh leaped backward, narrowly avoiding a cursed strike from the wraith that instantly decayed a dozen swords in its path.</p>

            <p>At that exact millisecond, Archer's time limit expired.</p>

            <p class="impact-line">The sky of gears shattered like a mirror struck by a hammer.</p>

            <p>The wasteland dissolved, and the suffocating atmosphere of the high-tech Himalayan bunker rushed back into our lungs.</p>

            <div class="scene-break"><span class="drip"></span></div>

            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 64 to 65: The Golden Departure and the Viral Truth</h2>

            <p>The spatial collapse threw us all to the concrete floor. Archer landed heavily on one knee, violently coughing up a spray of crimson blood. The Assassin, deprived of the chaotic mana storm, melted seamlessly back into the cracks of the bunker walls, having completed its master's objective.</p>

            <p>Gilgamesh stood amidst the flickering emergency lights. He looked down at the decapitated body of my cousin. There was no anger. Only cold amusement.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box fade-1">
                <span class="speaker gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"A King does not mourn a rat who dies in the dark. This farce has lost its entertainment value.

            </div>

            <div class="golden-dissolution">
                <span class="gd-name">Gilgamesh</span>
                <span class="gd-status">Servant Link Severed — Dematerializing</span>
            </div>

            <p>Gilgamesh dissolved into golden particles, abandoning the battlefield to seek out his new 'Kirei'.</p>

            <p>I struggled to my feet, my legs shaking. "Archer. Are you..."</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box ubw-mode">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Dying. Slowly. Master, the Grail War has officially begun. Without Command Seals, my anchor to this world is tearing. We must find the Overseer of this territory and formalize your contract, or I will fade by dawn."</p>
            </div>

            <p>I nodded, turning to leave. But Saber had stopped. She was staring at the floor near the cousin's body.</p>

            <p>The smartphone. It was still recording.</p>

            <p>I walked over and picked it up. My blood turned to ice. The bunker's backup generator hadn't just restored the lights; it had restored the satellite Wi-Fi. My cousin hadn't just been recording the fight.</p>
            
            <p>He had been live-streaming it to the cloud.</p>

            <p>The raw footage had already been ripped, clipped, and mirrored across ten thousand servers.</p>

            <p>I pulled out my own phone, which I had powered off in the SUV. I turned it on. A flood of thousands of notifications instantly froze the device for a solid ten seconds. When it finally loaded, I opened a news app. The "Shoe Video" was gone.</p>

            <p>In its place was a global state of emergency.</p>

            <div class="breaking-news">
                <div class="bn-bar">
                    <span class="bn-live"></span>
                    Breaking — Global Emergency
                </div>
                <div class="bn-body">
                    <div class="bn-headline">Superhuman entities confirmed in Himalayan border region. United Nations Security Council authorizes lethal force. Clock Tower masquerade status: COMPROMISED.</div>
                    <div class="bn-sub">Source: All major networks simultaneously · Confirmed by 14 intelligence agencies</div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The escalation was terrifyingly logical. The viral clip of Saber deflecting a hundred glowing weapons and Archer projecting a reality marble had triggered mass panic. Within an hour, the United Nations mobilized under the guise of an unprecedented, superhuman terrorist threat. And hidden behind the military's geopolitical panic, the Clock Tower's leyline monitors would be screaming. The masquerade of the Magi was breached.</p>

            <p>We were no longer a meme. We were a planetary target.</p>

            <div class="scene-break"><span class="drip"></span></div>

            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 66: The Town of Traitors</h2>

            <p>We fled the bunker before the dawn broke. Archer needed medical-grade supplies and high-density mana gems to stabilize his core, forcing us to detour into a populated Himalayan border town nestled in the valleys below.</p>

            <p>Saber and Archer dematerialized their armor, wearing civilian clothing we salvaged from the SUV. I pulled a hood low over my face. We needed to be ghosts. We walked into the crowded marketplace, the morning fog thick and biting.</p>

            <p>But the digital age leaves no shadows to hide in.</p>

            <p>I was standing near a pharmacy stall when a young man holding a phone pointed at me. His eyes went wide. Then, he didn't run. He yelled.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker npc">Civilian</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"It's him! The terrorist from the video! The freak with the monsters!"</p>
            </div>

            <p>The marketplace went dead silent. Then, the greed and the fear took over. The news had placed a massive, unprecedented bounty on my head. These were the "innocents" Saber had sworn to protect. They grabbed iron pipes, butcher knives, and heavy stones. A mob of fifty people surrounded us, their faces twisted with hatred and opportunism.</p>

            <p>A stone was thrown. It struck my shoulder, hard enough to bruise the bone.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Stop this! We do not wish to harm you!"</p>
            </div>

            <p>Saber stepped in front of me, refusing to draw her sword. She raised her arms, taking the brunt of the blows. A man swung a rusted pipe at her head; she caught it bare-handed, pushing him away gently. She was bleeding from a cut on her cheek, taking the abuse of the mortals she revered.</p>

            <p>Then, the chopping sound of helicopter blades drowned out the mob.</p>

            <div class="scene-break"><span class="drip"></span></div>

            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 67: The Slaughter of the Innocents</h2>

            <p>Three heavy military gunships crested the mountain ridge, hovering directly over the marketplace. Laser sights painted the crowd. The civilians stopped, cheering, thinking their protectors had arrived to arrest the anomalies.</p>

            <p>A megaphone blared from the lead gunship.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker military">Commander</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Targets acquired. The anomalies have engaged the civilian populace. Weapons free! Eradicate the crowd, but secure the anomalies alive. R&amp;D wants the dimensional technology intact. Fire!"</p>
            </div>

            <p>The civilians didn't even have time to scream.</p>

            <p>The gunships opened fire with heavy autocannons. They didn't aim for Saber or me. They aimed at the crowd, using the sheer volume of explosive rounds to turn the marketplace into a meat grinder. The military didn't care about collateral damage; they cared about securing the narrative and stealing the magic. To them, these people were just acceptable losses to frame us.</p>

            <p>Blood painted the snow. The people who had just been trying to kill me were now being ripped apart by their own government.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"NO!"</p>
            </div>

            <p>Saber screamed, a sound of absolute, soul-shattering despair.</p>

            <p>She leaped forward, throwing herself over a young boy and his mother. Her Prana Burst flared, deflecting the heavy rounds, but she was a fraction of a second too late. The mother was caught in the explosive radius, killed instantly.</p>

            <p>The firing ceased. The marketplace was a graveyard of smoke, fire, and torn bodies.</p>

            <p>Saber knelt in the bloody snow, her civilian clothes shredded, shielding the surviving boy beneath her arms. She looked down at him, her emerald eyes wide with desperate empathy, reaching out a trembling, bloodstained hand to comfort him.</p>

            <p>The boy looked at his dead mother, then looked up at Saber. There was no gratitude in his eyes. Only absolute, venomous hatred.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker npc">Boy</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Monster! You brought the metal birds! You killed her! I curse you! Demon! Demon!"</p>
            </div>

            <p>The boy shrieked, scrambling backward away from her, throwing a handful of bloody snow at her silver breastplate.</p>

            <p>I watched the King of Knights shatter. Not from a sword, but from the words of a child she had just bled to save. I was right all along. This timeline was a rotting corpse.</p>

            <p>A red laser dot cut through the smoke, settling directly between the screaming boy's eyes.</p>

            <p class="sound-effect">Crack.</p>

            <p>A sniper round from the gunship took the boy's life mid-curse. He crumpled into the snow, lifeless.</p>

            <p>Saber froze. The breath left her lungs.</p>

            <p>Ten heavy thuds echoed through the ruined marketplace as elite tactical operatives fast-roped down from the gunships. They wore heavy exosuits, their shoulder-mounted body cams blinking with red recording lights. They were here to capture the footage of the "heroic military" subduing the monsters.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker military">Squad Leader</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Hostiles surrounded. Engaging the Silver Demon."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Saber stood up slowly.</p>

            <p>She didn't use Excalibur's beam. She didn't grant them the honor of a Knight's strike. She used the wind.</p>

            <p>She moved like a phantom of pure vengeance. In less than three seconds, she was among them. She severed limbs, crushed reinforced helmets with her bare gauntlets, and tore through their exosuits as if they were wet paper. The operatives fired wildly, screaming as the Silver Knight systematically, brutally butchered all ten of them.</p>

            <p>When the last body hit the ground, Archer stepped out from the shadows of a burning stall. He held a military tablet he had stripped from the squad leader, its screen glowing with the live global feed.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box ubw-mode">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>

            </div>

            <p>He rasped, coughing blood as he tossed the tablet to my feet. I looked at the screen.</p>

            <p>The internet had already given us our titles. To the forums and the news anchors, I was <em>Vardilord</em>, the Demon King. The world was uniting to hunt us down, entirely blind to the fact that their own governments had orchestrated the massacre to steal our power.</p>

            <p>Saber stood amidst the carnage. Her silver armor was completely painted in the blood of soldiers and the civilians she had failed to save.</p>

            <p>She looked down at the bodies. Then she looked up at the hovering gunships.</p>

            <p>I watched the light die in her eyes, and a sickening weight dropped in my stomach. I had summoned her to be my sword, to validate my anger. But staring at the blood soaking into the Himalayan snow, I realized I hadn't just ended a timeline. I had broken the King of Knights.</p>

            <p>The conflict, the mercy, the honor that had defined her vanished. Her emerald eyes went completely, terrifyingly cold. The wind around her howled, not with the gentle breeze of Avalon, but with the violent fury of a dying star. She gripped the invisible hilt of her sword with both hands.</p>
