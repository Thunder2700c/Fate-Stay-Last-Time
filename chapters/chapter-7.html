            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Let it burn."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Saber didn't raise Excalibur to the sky. She didn't invoke its true name. To unleash the anti-fortress beam here would vaporize the mountain, the remaining civilians, and drain the last drops of my own life force. Instead, she reversed her grip on the invisible hilt and drove the blade directly into the blood-soaked snow.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Strike Air."</p>
            </div>

            <p>She released the compressed sheath of wind—<em>Invisible Air</em>—all at once. It wasn't a beam of light; it was a localized hurricane. A pressurized column of solid kinetic force erupted from the earth, slamming directly into the underbelly of the lead military gunship.</p>

            <p>The heavy, armored helicopter didn't just crash. It crumpled like an empty soda can caught in a hydraulic press. The rotors shattered, sending jagged shrapnel tearing through the freezing fog, and the twisted husk of the machine plummeted into the treeline below with a deafening, fiery explosion.</p>

            <p>The two remaining gunships immediately broke formation, banking hard to avoid the sheer atmospheric pressure Saber had just generated. Their side-mounted turrets whirred, tracking her for a retaliatory strike.</p>

            <p>But the guns never fired.</p>

            <p>A sharp, ear-splitting burst of static echoed not just from the gunships' external loudspeakers, but in the very air around us. The chaotic military chatter was violently overridden. A voice cut through the Himalayan wind—cold, aristocratic, and dripping with an ancient, terrifying authority that made the hairs on my arms stand up.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker magus">Lord</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Stand down, dogs."</p>
            </div>

            <p>It wasn't a general. It was a Magus. A Lord of the Clock Tower.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker magus">Lord</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"You are out of your depth, mundane fools. You are firing blind into the abyss of Mystery. Withdraw your toys. This territory is now under the absolute jurisdiction of the Mage's Association."</p>
            </div>

            <p>A powerful, invisible mental interference rippled across the valley. I could physically feel the oppressive weight of the Mage's spell pressing against my temples. The pilots above didn't argue. They didn't hesitate. The remaining gunships turned seamlessly and retreated into the clouds, fleeing as if they had just looked directly into the eyes of a predator.</p>

            <p>The silence that followed was heavier than the gunfire.</p>

            <p>Saber stood up, her silver armor stained red. She didn't look victorious. She looked hollow.</p>

            <p>Behind me, Archer collapsed.</p>

            <div class="scene-break"><span class="drip"></span></div>

            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 69: The Bleeding Trek</h2>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Archer!"</p>
            </div>

            <p>I rushed to his side.</p>

            <p>He fell hard against the snow, his red shroud tearing at the edges. But he wasn't bleeding blood anymore. His skin was fracturing like porcelain, and from the cracks, tiny motes of glowing blue ether were leaking into the air. His Spirit Core was shattering.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"The... Reality Marble... It drained the last of my anchor. I am dissolving, Master."</p>
            </div>

            <p>He rasped, his gray eyes dimming.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"No. Not yet. You don't get to die here."</p>
            </div>

            <p>I grabbed his arm, hauling him up over my shoulder. Saber rushed to his other side, taking the brunt of his weight.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Master, he needs a leyline convergence. A Spirit Vein. And we need an Overseer."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Saber spoke urgently, scanning the desolate, snow-blind peaks.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"I can... feel it. A massive pool of mana... an artificial bounded field. A sanctuary."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Archer whispered, raising a trembling, fractured hand toward the jagged northern ridge.</p>

            <p>We dragged him. For two agonizing hours, we climbed the treacherous, icy paths of the Himalayas. The cold bit through my thin clothes, turning my fingers blue, but the adrenaline of the massacre kept my legs moving.</p>

            <p>My mind spun, trying to process the absurdity of the last three days. Less than seventy hours ago, my biggest problem was a broken golden jutti and a bruised ego. Now, I was dragging a dying mythological hero through a blizzard, the United Nations had authorized lethal force against me, and the internet had crowned me <em>Vardilord</em>, the Demon King. The mediator was truly dead. I was a warlord now.</p>

            <p>At the end of the two hours, the blizzard broke. Nestled in a sheer cliff face, hidden entirely from satellite views by ancient Magecraft, stood a massive, snow-covered stone monastery.</p>

            <p>The doors were heavy, reinforced oak bound in iron. I didn't knock. I kicked them open.</p>

            <div class="scene-break"><span class="drip"></span></div>

            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 70: The College Bestie</h2>

            <p>The interior of the monastery was surprisingly warm, lit by hundreds of flickering wax candles. It smelled of frankincense and old parchment. At the far end of the long stone hall, standing before a massive altar, was a figure draped in the heavy, ceremonial robes of the Holy Church's Burial Agency.</p>

            <p>Hearing the doors crash open, the Overseer spun around. Three silver, cross-shaped blades—Black Keys—materialized instantly between his fingers. His eyes were wide, ready to execute whatever heresy had just breached his sanctuary.</p>

            <p>He looked at the dying man in red. He looked at the silver-armored Knight. Then, he looked at me.</p>

            <p>The Black Keys slipped from his fingers, clattering loudly against the stone floor.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker jaskaran">Overseer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"...Gurtej?"</p>
            </div>

            <p>I froze. My jaw physically dropped. I blinked, convinced the altitude and the cold had finally induced a hallucination.</p>

            <p>Underneath the intimidating, ancient vestments of the Holy Church was a face I had seen literally three days ago in the GNIMT cafeteria.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Jaskaran?! What the hell are you doing here?!"</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker jaskaran">Jaskaran</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"What am I doing here?! Bro! I was literally texting you yesterday about our BBA Financial Management assignment! Why weren't you answering your phone?! And why is the news calling you the Demon King Vardilord?!"</p>
            </div>

            <p>He screamed back, throwing his hands in the air, completely abandoning his stoic, holy persona.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"My cousin broke my shoe and posted it online! It's a long story! Why are you wearing a wizard robe?!"</p>
            </div>

            <p>Jaskaran ran a hand down his face, looking like he was about to have an aneurysm.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker jaskaran">Jaskaran</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"It's a Church cassock, you idiot! My family belongs to a hidden lineage of the Holy Church! I was stationed in Ludhiana to live a normal life and monitor the regional leylines! When your stupid shoe-video sparked a massive surge of True Ether, the Church recalled me here to act as the official Grail War Overseer!"</p>
            </div>

            <p>Saber looked between the two of us, her cold, hollow eyes registering profound confusion.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Master... you know the Overseer?"</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"He's my college best friend!"</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Fate... has a sick sense of humor."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Archer let out a weak, coughing laugh that sent a spray of blue ether into the air.</p>

            <p>His knees finally buckled. He collapsed onto the stone floor, his body becoming semi-transparent. The motes of light were accelerating.</p>

            <p>Jaskaran's demeanor instantly shifted. The panicked college student vanished, replaced by the cold, calculated efficiency of an Executor of the Holy Church. He rushed forward, sliding onto his knees beside Archer.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker jaskaran">Jaskaran</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"His Spirit Core is collapsing. He doesn't have an anchor. Give me your right hand."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="scene-break"><span class="drip"></span></div>

            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 71: The Ritual of the Saint Graph</h2>

            <p>I held out my hand. Jaskaran gripped my wrist, his eyes glowing with a faint, golden light. He began chanting in rapid, flawless Latin. A searing, branding pain ignited on the back of my hand. I hissed, falling to one knee as the skin blistered and reformed.</p>

            <p>When he let go, three jagged, blood-red marks—shaped like a burning crown—were etched into my flesh.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker jaskaran">Jaskaran</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Command Seals transferred from the Overseer's reserve. You are officially a Master in this War. But it's not enough. You don't have the Magic Circuits to sustain two top-tier Servants. If I don't alter their Saint Graphs right now, Archer dies, and Saber will drain your life force until your heart stops."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Do it. Whatever it takes."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Jaskaran pulled four Black Keys from his robes.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker jaskaran">Jaskaran</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Archer first. I'm going to forcibly stitch his Spirit Core to the Himalayan Spirit Vein directly beneath this church. Option A: Leyline Anchoring."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Jaskaran slammed the four blades directly into the stone floor around Archer, pinning the Servant's shadow to the ground. He began a heavy, booming aria, channeling the raw, tectonic mana of the mountain range up through the floorboards.</p>

            <p>Archer threw his head back and screamed. It was a harrowing sound of a mythological soul being violently re-written. The blue cracks on his skin filled with a deep, pulsing crimson light as the mountain's leyline physically forced its way into his magical circuits.</p>

            <p>When the light faded, Archer lay panting on the floor, his body completely solid again. The air around him was heavy with near-infinite magical energy.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker jaskaran">Jaskaran</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"He's stabilized. But there's a catch, Gurtej. He's tethered to the mountain now. He has unlimited mana to project his weapons, but if he leaves the Himalayan range, the tether snaps and he dies instantly. He is your ultimate sniper, but he is bound to this base."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Archer slowly pushed himself up, a cynical smirk returning to his face.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker archer">Archer</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"A guard dog for the Demon King. Fitting."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker jaskaran">Jaskaran</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"Saber's turn. I can't anchor you both. I have to use Option B for her."</p>
            </div>

            <p>He walked to the altar and retrieved a small, lead-lined lockbox. He opened it, revealing a single, crystalline vial containing a thick, crimson liquid that seemed to pulse with its own heartbeat.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker jaskaran">Jaskaran</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"A purified drop of the original Holy Grail's mud. An elixir of incarnation. Saber, if you drink this, you will cease to be a spirit. You will be granted a true, physical body of flesh and blood. You won't drain Gurtej's mana anymore. You will generate your own energy. You will need to eat, sleep, and breathe like a human."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Saber looked at the vial. Her eyes flickered to the blood still staining her armor—the blood of the innocent people she couldn't save.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker saber">Saber</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"I failed them as a spirit. Perhaps I will be a better weapon as a mortal."</p>
            </div>

            <p>She took the vial and drank it in a single motion.</p>

            <p>The transformation was silent, but terrifying in its absolute finality. The faint, ethereal glow that always surrounded Saber simply... vanished. The heavy, oppressive weight of her presence grounded itself.</p>

            <p>The church was dead quiet. And then, I heard it.</p>

            <p class="sound-effect">Thump-thump.</p>

            <p>A heartbeat. Saber gasped, her eyes widening. She dropped to her knees, wrapping her arms around herself. She was shivering. The freezing air of the church, which had never bothered her as a Servant, was now biting into her human skin. Her breath plumed in the cold air.</p>

            <p>The King of Knights was flesh and blood.</p>

            <h2 class="hour-heading">Hour 72: The New Board</h2>

            <p>Jaskaran threw a heavy wool blanket over Saber's shoulders, then walked to the altar, returning with a map of the world and a stack of classified Clock Tower dossiers. He spread them across the stone floor.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker jaskaran">Jaskaran</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"You guys need to understand the reality of the board. The entire world thinks you are a superhuman terrorist organization. The UN is mobilizing conventional armies. But they are the least of your worries."</p>
            </div>

            <p>He pointed to a red marker on the map over London.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker jaskaran">Jaskaran</span>

            </div>

            <p>He pointed to a black marker over Rome.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker jaskaran">Jaskaran</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"The Burial Agency. My bosses. The Church's elite executioners. They view your Reality Marble and the viral footage as ultimate heresy. They will send Assassins to erase you."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Jaskaran looked up, meeting my eyes.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker jaskaran">Jaskaran</span>
                <p class="dialogue-text">"And worst of all, Gurtej... because you forced the Grail to awaken, it had to balance the scales. The global war has officially begun. The Grail has chosen other Masters around the world. Seven Servants total."</p>
            </div>

            <p>I thought of the golden particles dissolving in the bunker, and the horrific shadow that took my cousin's head.</p>

            <div class="dialogue-box">
                <span class="speaker master">Gurtej</span>

            </div>

            <p>I looked at Archer, leaning against the stone pillar, radiating the limitless power of the mountain. I looked at Saber, staring into the flickering candlelight, feeling the pulse of a human heart in her chest. I looked at the three blood-red Command Seals burning on my hand.</p>

            <p>The mediator who walked into a Ludhiana banquet hall three days ago was dead. The world had forced me to become a monster, and I was going to play the part perfectly.</p>
